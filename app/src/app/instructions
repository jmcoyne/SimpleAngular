## Interview Code Test ##

# Note: Coding style does not matter. The only thing that matters is the problem is solved.
# You may use google or any other resources in order to complete the task.
# Instructions:

1. Go to the component titled problem1 and follow the instructions in the comments to complete the task.

2. Generate a component called problem2, and then create a button that when clicked, will display an alert with the message "Hello World", and then create the routing so this component can be accessed by clicking a link

3. Create a unit test using karma/jasmine testing the functionality of the button in problem2, so that when the button is clicked, the alert will display and the test will pass.

4. Debug the code contained in the problem3 component. 

Ideas: 
	- Write css for any of them?
	- Write a unit test for problem3 after fixing it?
	- Write an API call
